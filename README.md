## How to develop DSP ground up?

1. Plan, Ideas

2. DSP

The core of the plugin is the reverb algorithm that processes the incoming audio signal and applies the reverb effect. This algorithm can be based on various techniques such as convolution, physical modeling, or algorithmic processing

3. Develop

4  Test, Debug

5  UI

The user interface provides the controls for adjusting the various parameters of the reverb effect. The UI typically includes sliders, knobs, buttons, and displays.

Layout: The layout should be organized and intuitive, with easy-to-understand controls that are logically arranged. Consider grouping related controls together and using labels or graphics to help users understand the purpose of each control.

Visual feedback: The UI should provide visual feedback to users as they adjust the various controls. Consider using meters, graphs, or animations to show the effect of the changes being made.

Control types: Choose control types that are appropriate for the parameter being adjusted. For example, a slider might be appropriate for adjusting reverb decay time, while a drop-down menu might be better for selecting different reverb types.

Customizability: Consider providing options for customizing the UI to suit the user's preferences. For example, users might want to change the color scheme or adjust the size of the controls.

Responsiveness: The UI should be responsive and fast, with minimal lag between user input and visual feedback. Consider optimizing the plugin's code to ensure that it can handle real-time audio processing without lag or glitches.


6. Misc

**Input/output handling**: The plugin needs to handle audio input and output in the form of digital audio signals. The plugin must be able to receive audio input, process it, and output the processed audio.

**Preset management**: Users of the plugin may want to save and recall different reverb settings. The plugin should include a preset management system that allows users to save and load different reverb settings.
